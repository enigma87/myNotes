# QuickStart(markdown) Title

## Tabs, linebreaks, h2 titles

    tabs at the start of a paragraph is code?

This is gonna be a paragraph that demonstrates that two spaces and a linebreak at the end of this paragraph will let you start

A new paragph, does it make sense?

## Bold, Italics, bold italics

**That was bold**  
_Italic calligraphy is interesting_  
**_Markdown is better than Markup_**

## Blockquote

> a lot of frameworks are structured around a 12 column grid, but a flexible and responsive grid doesn't always fit into this structure. In this article, we just saw how blockquotes work.
>
> > Blockquotes can be nested? who knew!
